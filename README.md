Various bits of code Releated to work and stories I do for PL

While my typically brain dribbling for PL is baseball history,
one typically can't seperate baseball stats from baseball 
history. 

This is a collection of various scripts and such I have used
for baseball research. 

Also, PL is writing some articles about data collection, analysis
and such. I'll include the code here so folks don't have to 
transcripe it themselves. And, knowning me, I'll make changes 
to it.
